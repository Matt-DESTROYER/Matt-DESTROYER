		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			Hi there!
			I'm Matthew (but most people call me Matt).
			I'm a 19 year old Australian student, with a few years of experience programming.

				<p>
					JavaScript was my first ever language, and remains my most proficient language, but my favourite language as of late has been C!
				</p>
				<p>
					In the past I've had a somewhat irrational dislike of Python because of it's syntax...
					But it's grown on me.
				</p>
				<p>
					A little.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently I've been very interested in Rust (how stereotypical), and WebAssembly technology.
					As such it should come as no surprise, I rewrote the backend for this website in Rust!
					You can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/Matt-DESTROYER/Matt-DESTROYER">the GitHub repo</a>...
					Just don't look at the commit history ;)
