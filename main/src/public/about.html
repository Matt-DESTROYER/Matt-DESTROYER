		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			Hi there!
			I'm Matthew (but most people call me Matt).
			I'm a 19 year old Australian student, with a few years of experience programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			JavaScript was my first ever language, and remains my most proficient language, but my favourite language as of late has been C!
			In the past I've had a somewhat irrational dislike of Python because of it's syntax...
			But it's grown on me.
			A little.
			I've been very interested in Rust recently (how stereotypical).
			As such it should come as no surprise, I rewrote the backend for this website in Rust!
			You can check it out on the GitHub repo...
			Just don't look at the commit history ;)
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>This website is undergoing some major changes (it's 2 years out of date), so check back soon!</p>
